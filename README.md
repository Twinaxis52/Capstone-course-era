# IBM Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

Welcome to my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Specialization. This project demonstrates the skills and techniques I have learned throughout the course, applying data science concepts to real-world problems.

## Project Overview:
In this project, I will showcase the application of data science principles, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to provide insights into a real-world dataset, leveraging tools and techniques such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, outliers, and formatting issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gaining insights through visualization and statistical methods.
- **Modeling**: Building predictive models and evaluating their performance.
- **Final Report**: A comprehensive report documenting the entire data science process.
