# Labs Jupyter SpaceX - Capstone Project

Welcome to the Labs Jupyter SpaceX Capstone project! This project is part of the Capstone Course Era, where we analyze and visualize data related to SpaceX missions and launches using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Overview:
- This project involves analyzing and visualizing SpaceX launch data to gain insights into the company's mission performance, launch outcomes, and trends.
- The project includes the use of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and others for data exploration and visualization.
- We explore historical SpaceX launch data, looking at mission success rates, rocket types, and other related metrics.

## Features:
- **Data Exploration**: Clean and preprocess SpaceX mission data.
- **Visualizations**: Create meaningful graphs to visualize launch success rates, mission types, and other key performance indicators.
- **Insights**: Derive actionable insights from the data to inform future SpaceX strategies and missions.
